GOALS:

1. Please make a web GUI for using HTTP API server...


Constraints:
1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.
2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.
3. No user assistance
4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"

Commands:
1. duckduckgo_search: A wrapper around DuckDuckGo Search. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query., args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
2. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}, "append": {"title": "Append", "description": "Whether to append to an existing file.", "default": false, "type": "boolean"}}
3. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
4. process_csv: process_csv(csv_file_path: str, instructions: str, output_path: Optional[str] = None) -> str - Process a CSV by with pandas in a limited REPL. Only use this after writing data to disk as a csv file. Any figures must be saved to disk to be viewed by the human. Instructions should be written in natural language, not code. Assume the dataframe is already loaded., args json schema: {"csv_file_path": {"title": "Csv File Path", "type": "string"}, "instructions": {"title": "Instructions", "type": "string"}, "output_path": {"title": "Output Path", "type": "string"}}
5. query_webpage: Browse a webpage and retrieve the information relevant to the question., args json schema: {"url": {"title": "Url", "type": "string"}, "question": {"title": "Question", "type": "string"}}
6. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"

Constraints:
1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.
2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.
3. No user assistance
4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"

Commands:
1. duckduckgo_search: A wrapper around DuckDuckGo Search. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query., args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
2. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}, "append": {"title": "Append", "description": "Whether to append to an existing file.", "default": false, "type": "boolean"}}
3. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
4. process_csv: process_csv(csv_file_path: str, instructions: str, output_path: Optional[str] = None) -> str - Process a CSV by with pandas in a limited REPL. Only use this after writing data to disk as a csv file. Any figures must be saved to disk to be viewed by the human. Instructions should be written in natural language, not code. Assume the dataframe is already loaded., args json schema: {"csv_file_path": {"title": "Csv File Path", "type": "string"}, "instructions": {"title": "Instructions", "type": "string"}, "output_path": {"title": "Output Path", "type": "string"}}
5. query_webpage: Browse a webpage and retrieve the information relevant to the question., args json schema: {"url": {"title": "Url", "type": "string"}, "question": {"title": "Question", "type": "string"}}

3. No user assistance
4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"

Commands:
1. duckduckgo_search: A wrapper around DuckDuckGo Search. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query., args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
2. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}, "append": {"title": "Append", "description": "Whether to append to an existing file.", "default": false, "type": "boolean"}}
3. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
4. process_csv: process_csv(csv_file_path: str, instructions: str, output_path: Optional[str] = None) -> str - Process a CSV by with pandas in a limited REPL. Only use this after writing data to disk as a csv file. Any figures must be saved to disk to be viewed by the human. Instructions should be written in natural language, not code. Assume the dataframe is already loaded., args json schema: {"csv_file_path": {"title": "Csv File Path", "type": "string"}, "instructions": {"title": "Instructions", "type": "string"}, "output_path": {"title": "Output Path", "type": "string"}}
5. query_webpage: Browse a webpage and retrieve the information relevant to the question., args json schema: {"url": {"title": "Url", "type": "string"}, "question": {"title": "Question", "type": "string"}}
6. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"

1. duckduckgo_search: A wrapper around DuckDuckGo Search. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query., args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
2. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}, "append": {"title": "Append", "description": "Whether to append to an existing file.", "default": false, "type": "boolean"}}
3. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
4. process_csv: process_csv(csv_file_path: str, instructions: str, output_path: Optional[str] = None) -> str - Process a CSV by with pandas in a limited REPL. Only use this after writing data to disk as a csv file. Any figures must be saved to disk to be viewed by the human. Instructions should be written in natural language, not code. Assume the dataframe is already loaded., args json schema: {"csv_file_path": {"title": "Csv File Path", "type": "string"}, "instructions": {"title": "Instructions", "type": "string"}, "output_path": {"title": "Output Path", "type": "string"}}
5. query_webpage: Browse a webpage and retrieve the information relevant to the question., args json schema: {"url": {"title": "Url", "type": "string"}, "question": {"title": "Question", "type": "string"}}
6. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"

1. duckduckgo_search: A wrapper around DuckDuckGo Search. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query., args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
2. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}, "append": {"title": "Append", "description": "Whether to append to an existing file.", "default": false, "type": "boolean"}}
3. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
4. process_csv: process_csv(csv_file_path: str, instructions: str, output_path: Optional[str] = None) -> str - Process a CSV by with pandas in a limited REPL. Only use this after writing data to disk as a csv file. Any figures must be saved to disk to be viewed by the human. Instructions should be written in natural language, not code. Assume the dataframe is already loaded., args json schema: {"csv_file_path": {"title": "Csv File Path", "type": "string"}, "instructions": {"title": "Instructions", "type": "string"}, "output_path": {"title": "Output Path", "type": "string"}}
5. query_webpage: Browse a webpage and retrieve the information relevant to the question., args json schema: {"url": {"title": "Url", "type": "string"}, "question": {"title": "Question", "type": "string"}}
6. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"
