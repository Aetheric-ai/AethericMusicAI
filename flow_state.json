            "Human:: Document the following code: In order to implement the signup system in TypeScript using Supabase based on the provided algorithmic pseudocode and codebase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Import necessary modules and dependencies.\n2. Implement the `useEffect` hook to check if a user is already authenticated when the `MainPanel` component renders.\n3. Define a function `handleFormSubmit` to handle form submission.\n4. Implement the form for user signup in the `UpperPanel` component.\n5. Implement the `LowerPanel` component which will display a message or instructions based on `promptInstruction` state.\n\nLet's start by importing the necessary modules and dependencies. \n\n```typescript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { Auth } from '@supabase/ui';\nimport { supabase } from './supabaseClient';\nimport UpperPanel from './UpperPanel';\nimport LowerPanel from './LowerPanel';\n```\n\nNext, we'll add the `useEffect` hook inside the `MainPanel` component to check if a user is already authenticated when the component renders. If a user is found, we'll update the `user` state with the returned user.\n\n```typescript\nconst MainPanel = () => {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  const [promptInstructionForLowerPanel, setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel] = useState('');  \n  const [formData, setFormData] = useState('');\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);  \n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const user = supabase.auth.user();\n    if (user) {\n      setUser(user);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex h-screen\">\n      <UpperPanel setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel={setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel} \n      isLoading={isLoading}\n      setIsLoading={setIsLoading}      \n      />\n      <LowerPanel promptInstruction={promptInstructionForLowerPanel} isLoading={isLoading} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nNow, let's define a function `handleFormSubmit` to handle form submission. This function will be passed as a prop to the `UpperPanel` component.\n\n```typescript\nconst handleFormSubmit = async (event) => {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  setIsLoading(true);\n  const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp(formData);\n  if (error) {\n    setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel(error.message);\n  } else {\n    setUser(user);\n  }\n  setIsLoading(false);\n};\n```\n\nWe'll continue with the next steps in the following code blocks.",
            "AI: # TypeScript Signup System with Supabase\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive guide and explanation of the TypeScript signup system using Supabase. The system consists of several components including MainPanel, UpperPanel, and LowerPanel, as well as the use of the Supabase client for authentication. \n\n## Overview\n\nThe signup system is designed to authenticate users using Supabase, a modern and open-source backend service. The system is built with TypeScript and React, utilizing React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects respectively.\n\nThe system is divided into three main components:\n\n- `MainPanel`: This is the parent component that holds the state for the user, prompt instructions, form data, and loading status. It also contains the useEffect hook to check if a user is already authenticated when the component renders.\n- `UpperPanel`: This component contains the form for user signup.\n- `LowerPanel`: This component displays a message or instructions based on the `promptInstruction` state.\n\n## Importing Modules and Dependencies\n\nThe first step is to import the necessary modules and dependencies. We import React, useState, and useEffect from the 'react' library. We also import Auth from '@supabase/ui', the UI library for Supabase, and our initialized Supabase client from './supabaseClient'. Finally, we import our UpperPanel and LowerPanel components.\n\n```typescript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { Auth } from '@supabase/ui';\nimport { supabase } from './supabaseClient';\nimport UpperPanel from './UpperPanel';\nimport LowerPanel from './LowerPanel';\n```\n\n## The MainPanel Component\n\nThe `MainPanel` component is the parent component that holds the state for the user, prompt instructions, form data, and loading status. It also contains the useEffect hook to check if a user is already authenticated when the component renders.\n\n```typescript\nconst MainPanel = () => {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  const [promptInstructionForLowerPanel, setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel] = useState('');  \n  const [formData, setFormData] = useState('');\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);  \n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const user = supabase.auth.user();\n    if (user) {\n      setUser(user);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex h-screen\">\n      <UpperPanel setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel={setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel} \n      isLoading={isLoading}\n      setIsLoading={setIsLoading}      \n      />\n      <LowerPanel promptInstruction={promptInstructionForLowerPanel} isLoading={isLoading} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn the `MainPanel` component, we define four pieces of state:\n\n- `user`: This is initially set to null and will hold the authenticated user, if one exists.\n- `promptInstructionForLowerPanel`: This holds the instructions or messages to be displayed in the `LowerPanel` component.\n- `formData`: This is initially an empty string and will hold the form data from the signup form.\n- `isLoading`: This is initially set to false and will be used to manage the loading state of the form.\n\nThe useEffect hook checks if a user is already authenticated when the component renders. If a user is found, the `user` state is updated with the returned user.\n\n## The handleFormSubmit Function\n\nNext, we define a function `handleFormSubmit` to handle form submission. This function will be passed as a prop to the `UpperPanel` component.\n\n```typescript\nconst handleFormSubmit = async (event) => {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  setIsLoading(true);\n  const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp(formData);\n  if (error) {\n    setPromptInstructionForLowerPanel(error.message);\n  } else {\n    setUser(user);\n  }\n  setIsLoading(false);\n};\n```\n\nIn the `handleFormSubmit` function, we first prevent the default form submission behavior with `event.preventDefault()`. We then set `isLoading` to true to indicate that the form is being submitted. \n\nWe then call `supabase.auth.signUp` with the `formData` as an argument. This function returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the user and any error that might have occurred during the signup process.\n\nIf an error occurs during the signup process, we update `promptInstructionForLowerPanel` with the error message. If the signup is successful, we update the `user` state with the returned user. Finally, we set `isLoading` to false to indicate that the form submission has completed.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe implementation of the `UpperPanel` and `LowerPanel` components will be covered in the following sections. The `UpperPanel` component will contain the form for user signup, while the `LowerPanel` component will display a message or instructions based on the `promptInstructionForLowerPanel` state.",
