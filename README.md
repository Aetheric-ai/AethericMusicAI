Welcome to Swarms - the future of AI, where we leverage the power of autonomous agents to create 'swarms' of Language Models (LLM) that work together, creating a dynamic and interactive AI system.

---

## Vision
Artificial Intelligence has grown at an exponential rate over the past decade. Yet, we are far from fully harnessing its potential. Today's AI operates in isolation, each working separately in their corner. But life doesn't work like that. The world doesn't work like that. Success isn't built in silos; it's built in teams.

Imagine a world where AI models work in unison. Where they can collaborate, interact, and pool their collective intelligence to achieve more than any single model could. This is the future we envision. But today, we lack a framework for AI to collaborate effectively, to form a true swarm of intelligent agents.


This is a difficult problem, one that has eluded solution. It requires sophisticated systems that can allow individual models to not just communicate but also understand each other, pool knowledge and resources, and create collective intelligence. This is the next frontier of AI.

But here at Swarms, we have a secret sauce. It's not just a technology or a breakthrough invention. It's a way of thinking - the philosophy of rapid iteration. With each cycle, we make massive progress. We experiment, we learn, and we grow. We have developed a pioneering framework that can enable AI models to work together as a swarm, combining their strengths to create richer, more powerful outputs.

We are uniquely positioned to take on this challenge with 1,500+ devoted researchers in Agora. We have assembled a team of world-class experts, experienced and driven, united by a shared vision. Our commitment to breaking barriers, pushing boundaries, and our belief in the power of collective intelligence makes us the best team to usher in this future to fundamentally advance our species, Humanity.

## Installation
There are 2 methods, one is through `git clone` and the other is by `pip install swarms`. Check out the [document](/DOCUMENTATION.md) for more information on the classes.
---

# Method1
* Pip install `python3 -m pip install swarms`

* Create new python file and unleash superintelligence

```python

from swarms import swarm

api_key = "api key for openai"

objective = "What is the capital of the Uk"

result = swarm(api_key, objective)
print(result)
```

---

# Method 2
Download via Github, and install requirements. Simple example by:

* `git cloning https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms.git`

* `cd swarms`

* `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

* `python3 example.py`

* or create a new file:

```python
from swarms.swarms import Swarms

# Retrieve your API key from the environment or replace with your actual key
api_key = "sksdsds"

# Initialize Swarms with your API key
swarm = Swarms(openai_api_key=api_key)

# Define an objective
objective = """
Please develop and serve a simple community web service. 
People can signup, login, post, comment. 
Post and comment should be visible at once. 
I want it to have neumorphism-style. 
The ports you can use are 4500 and 6500.
"""

# Run Swarms
swarm.run_swarms(objective)
```

This will create and execute a task to write a summary about the latest news on quantum computing. The result will be the summary of the news.

# Roadmap

Please checkout our [Roadmap](DOCS/ROADMAP.md) and consider contributing to make the dream of Swarms real to advance Humanity.

## Optimization Priorities

1. **Reliability**: Increase the reliability of the swarm - obtaining the desired output with a basic and un-detailed input.

2. **Speed**: Reduce the time it takes for the swarm to accomplish tasks by improving the communication layer, critiquing, and self-alignment with meta prompting.

3. **Scalability**: Ensure that the system is asynchronous, concurrent, and self-healing to support scalability.

Our goal is to continuously improve Swarms by following this roadmap, while also being adaptable to new needs and opportunities as they arise.

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Building the Foundation
In the first phase, our focus is on building the basic infrastructure of Swarms. This includes developing key components like the Swarms class, integrating essential tools, and establishing task completion and evaluation logic. We'll also start developing our testing and evaluation framework during this phase. If you're interested in foundational work and have a knack for building robust, scalable systems, this phase is for you.

### Phase 2: Optimizing the System
In the second phase, we'll focus on optimizng Swarms by integrating more advanced features, improving the system's efficiency, and refining our testing and evaluation framework. This phase involves more complex tasks, so if you enjoy tackling challenging problems and contributing to the development of innovative features, this is the phase for you.

### Phase 3: Towards Super-Intelligence
The third phase of our bounty program is the most exciting - this is where we aim to achieve super-intelligence. In this phase, we'll be working on improving the swarm's capabilities, expanding its skills, and fine-tuning the system based on real-world testing and feedback. If you're excited about the future of AI and want to contribute to a project that could potentially transform the digital world, this is the phase for you.

Remember, our roadmap is a guide, and we encourage you to bring your own ideas and creativity to the table. We believe that every contribution, no matter how small, can make a difference. So join us on this exciting journey and help us create the future of Swarms.
