# Swarms Project Development Environment

This repository uses [VS Code's Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to standardize the development environment. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in VS Code.

4. Clone this repository and open it in VS Code.

5. When prompted to reopen the project in a container, click "Reopen in Container". 

   If you missed the prompt, you can open the command palette (F1) and run the "Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container" command.

6. Wait for the container to build. This can take a few minutes the first time.

7. You're now developing inside a Docker container! Any changes you make will be reflected in the container.

For more information, see the [VS Code Dev Containers documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
