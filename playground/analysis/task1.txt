Observation: 

Todo List:

1. Create a basic HTML page with a simple form for user input
2. Add a text input field and url array field to the form
3. Create a JavaScript function to capture and format the user input into JSON
4. Create a JavaScript function to make an AJAX call to the HTTP API server
5. Create a JavaScript function to process the response from the server and display it to the user
6. Add neumorphism-style styling to the HTML page
7. Create a Python script to run the server on port 4500
8. Create a worker agent to complete the task

Once the worker agent is created, it will be responsible for completing the task by following the todo list. It will be able to execute the HTML page, JavaScript functions, and Python script to make the web GUI for using the HTTP API server.
